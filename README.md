# nanopore-RNN

This is a repo for development of a pipeline for labelling nanopore reads and training a RNN.

In the short term this will be where Rojin and Bailey get things up and running.

Embedding labels using signalAlign can be found here:

Pipeline for running signalAlign can be found here:
