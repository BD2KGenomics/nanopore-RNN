# nanopore-RNN

This is a repo for development of a pipeline for labelling nanopore reads and training a RNN.

In the short term this will be where Rojin and Bailey get things up and running.

Embedding labels using signalAlign can be found here:
https://github.com/adbailey4/signalAlign/blob/embed_labels/src/signalalign/embed_signalalign.py

Pipeline for running signalAlign can be found in the scripts folder.

Python modules required for the nanoBLSTM.py script to work

keras
sklearn
h5py

If you decide to help contribute please use pylint so our code is readable.
